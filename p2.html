<h1><p>1.Importance of Internet to Education:</p></h1>
<p><h3>Research: The internet has a wide range of information that both teachers and students can access at the convenience of their locations. The distinction of scholarly domains from personal, organizational, and government domains makes it easy to find reliable information. Also, students have access to resources published in any period because most of them are available on internet platforms.</p></h3>
 <p><h3>Increased Accessibility of Education: Education is accessible now more than ever, thanks to the internet. Several reputable institutions of learning like Yale and Harvard universities have free courses in diverse areas through platforms like Coursera. In most cases, one has to pay for a certificate, but the lessons are completely free of charge.</p></h3> 
 <p><h3>Ease of Communication: Teachers and students can interact timely using internet platforms. A student no longer has to wait until the next class to communicate with their classmates or teachers. One can easily send a message to the teacher or student in question through online platforms. Additionally, most schools have online platforms where students hold discussions on various topics and assignnments.</p></h3>
 <h1><p/>2.Importance of Internet to the Society:The Internet plays an important role in the society in the following ways.</p></h1>
<p><h3>Internationalization: The internet facilitates important international relationships and connections. These international interactions are important in trade, social exposure, cultural knowledge, and embracing diversity. The internet facilitates the interaction between different countries and individuals from different nations without formal agreements.</p></h3>
 <p><h3>Globalization :Compared to internationalization, globalization is more formal and focuses on the global economy. The internet is crucial in establishing one global economy because it eliminates the physical boundaries that most avenues of business and communication have.</p></h3>
  <p><h3>Communication: Today, most people use the internet primarily for communication. The diverse communication platforms ensure that everyone has a preferred network. Businesses tend to prefer formal platforms like LinkedIn and emails while young people prefer the less formal chatting sites such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Most forms of communication including those on mobile phones require connectivity to the internet.</p></h3> 
  <h1><p>3.Importance of Internet in Health:The health sector has not been left behind. This sector has had to embrace the internet because of the following:</p></h1> 
  <p><h3>Free medical information: Doctors and other health practitioners run various internet pages where they provide quality medical information. This information is useful to medical students and the public. Now, self-diagnosis is not recommended on these pages. However, they provide understanding after a known diagnosis. The patient can learn more about the disease they suffer from and how to care for themselves. Some of the pages also provide home remedies for simple conditions like migraines, stomach aches, and menstrual period pains.</p></h3>
   <p><h3>Online hospitals :These hospitals take the patientâ€™s research a notch higher. The patient can talk to the doctors like in a traditional consultation. The doctor would then provide a diagnosis and prescribed treatment. There are also platforms for people recovering from addiction or simply seeking help. FRANK, in the United Kingdom, is an example of a functioning online addiction helpline. The anonymity that comes with online health platforms encourages patients to be more honest than in face-to-face discussions. The importance of the internet, in this case, is in the facilitation of these services in a timely manner.</p></h3> 
   <p><h3>Cyber-surgery: The internet partially solved the problem of distance in medicine. Doctors can now guide each other during surgery with the help of the internet and the 3 Dimension technologies. All that the doctors need is a clear line of communication and internet connection during the surgery. The patients and doctors save both money and time.</p></h3>S
