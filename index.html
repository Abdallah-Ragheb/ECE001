</ul><h1>introduction:</h1>

<p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment. In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes are just a very few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established.<p/>
<p>Over 9 billion Things (physical objects) are currently connected to the Internet, as of now. In the near future, this number is expected to rise to a whopping 20 billion.</p></h3>
<p><h3>It is almost impossible to imagine a world without the internet. The simplest activities such as communication and entertainment rely heavily on the internet. The internet, based on its definition, connects different computers and users. Today, the internet does more than just connecting computers. The internet connects people, lives, stories, and businesses. It is a source of information, a social platform, and a business network. The internet has diverse uses depending on the needs of an individual or the setting. Regardless of the purpose, the importance of the internet in our daily lives is unquestionable.</p></h3>

</ul><h1>lecture review:</h1>
<h1><p>1.Importance of Internet to Education:</p></h1>
<p><h3>Research: The internet has a wide range of information that both teachers and students can access at the convenience of their locations. The distinction of scholarly domains from personal, organizational, and government domains makes it easy to find reliable information. Also, students have access to resources published in any period because most of them are available on internet platforms.</p></h3>
 <p><h3>Increased Accessibility of Education: Education is accessible now more than ever, thanks to the internet. Several reputable institutions of learning like Yale and Harvard universities have free courses in diverse areas through platforms like Coursera. In most cases, one has to pay for a certificate, but the lessons are completely free of charge.</p></h3> 
 <p><h3>Ease of Communication: Teachers and students can interact timely using internet platforms. A student no longer has to wait until the next class to communicate with their classmates or teachers. One can easily send a message to the teacher or student in question through online platforms. Additionally, most schools have online platforms where students hold discussions on various topics and assignnments.</p></h3>
 <h1><p/>2.Importance of Internet to the Society:The Internet plays an important role in the society in the following ways.</p></h1>
<p><h3>Internationalization: The internet facilitates important international relationships and connections. These international interactions are important in trade, social exposure, cultural knowledge, and embracing diversity. The internet facilitates the interaction between different countries and individuals from different nations without formal agreements.</p></h3>
 <p><h3>Globalization :Compared to internationalization, globalization is more formal and focuses on the global economy. The internet is crucial in establishing one global economy because it eliminates the physical boundaries that most avenues of business and communication have.</p></h3>
  <p><h3>Communication: Today, most people use the internet primarily for communication. The diverse communication platforms ensure that everyone has a preferred network. Businesses tend to prefer formal platforms like LinkedIn and emails while young people prefer the less formal chatting sites such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Most forms of communication including those on mobile phones require connectivity to the internet.</p></h3> 
  <h1><p>3.Importance of Internet in Health:The health sector has not been left behind. This sector has had to embrace the internet because of the following:</p></h1> 
  <p><h3>Free medical information: Doctors and other health practitioners run various internet pages where they provide quality medical information. This information is useful to medical students and the public. Now, self-diagnosis is not recommended on these pages. However, they provide understanding after a known diagnosis. The patient can learn more about the disease they suffer from and how to care for themselves. Some of the pages also provide home remedies for simple conditions like migraines, stomach aches, and menstrual period pains.</p></h3>
   <p><h3>Online hospitals :These hospitals take the patientâ€™s research a notch higher. The patient can talk to the doctors like in a traditional consultation. The doctor would then provide a diagnosis and prescribed treatment. There are also platforms for people recovering from addiction or simply seeking help. FRANK, in the United Kingdom, is an example of a functioning online addiction helpline. The anonymity that comes with online health platforms encourages patients to be more honest than in face-to-face discussions. The importance of the internet, in this case, is in the facilitation of these services in a timely manner.</p></h3> 
   <p><h3>Cyber-surgery: The internet partially solved the problem of distance in medicine. Doctors can now guide each other during surgery with the help of the internet and the 3 Dimension technologies. All that the doctors need is a clear line of communication and internet connection during the surgery. The patients and doctors save both money and time.</p></h3>S

<p><h1>conclusion:</p></h1>
<p> <h3>the Internet of Things is closer to being implemented than the average person would think. Most of the necessary technological advances needed for it have already been made, and some manufacturers and agencies have already begun implementing a small-scale version of it. The main reasons why it has not truly been implemented is the impact it will have on the legal, ethical, security and social fields. Workers could potentially abuse it, hackers could potentially access it, corporations may not want to share their data, and individual people may not like the complete absence of privacy. For these reasons, the Internet of Things may very well be pushed back longer than it truly needs to be.</p></h3>
